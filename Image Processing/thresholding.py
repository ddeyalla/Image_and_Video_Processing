#thresholding either 0 or 1. black or white
#apply threshold as binary on image
#grayscale the image
#apply gaussian adaptive threshold
#The thresholding algorithms can be categorized into six classes: 
#      histogram shape-based methods
#      clustering-based methods
#      entropy based methods
#      object attribute-based methods
#      the spatial methods
#      local methods based on the local characteristics of each pixel
#Otsuâ€™s thresholding technique is a classification-based method which searches for the the threshold that minimizes the
#   intra-class variance, defined as a weighted
#   sum of variances of the two classes
